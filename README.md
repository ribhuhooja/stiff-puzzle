# Breakout

This is a toy version of my [Breakout repository](https://github.com/ajoohuhbir/breakout-basic)
for a DSOCSS puzzle.

Can you figure out how to fix the paddle? Can you figure out why the fix works?


# Installation instructions
You will need python and pygame to run this program.  
Installing python: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
Make sure to add it to path!  

Once you've done that, pip should be in path. In the command line, run  
```
pip install pygame
```

Now, you can download the files! Probably the best way to do that is to clone the repository.   
Once you have all the files for the repository, `cd` to that directory, then `cd src` and run  

```
python main.py
```
or
```
python3 main.py
```
(depending on your system)
